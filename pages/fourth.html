  <div class="desc">Your day begins with breakfast, this could be oatmeal with fruit or eggs, or whole grain toast with peanut butter. If you want a lighter breakfast, a smoothie with fruit & yogurt or spinach works well. The mid-morning snack should be simple, boiled egg, piece of fruit, or nuts and don't forget to drink water throughout the morning to keep it hydrated and also help with your digestion.</div>

  <div class="desc">For lunch, balance your meal with protein, grains, & some veggies (example: grilled chicken or tofu with brown rice & green salad). The faster you eat, the easier it is to eat more than you need, especially when you grab things to eat on the go or don't acknowledge when you're satisfied. In the afternoon, if you're hungry, it's ok to have a healthy snack (example: yogurt or carrot sticks), but try to avoid sugary snacks and foods and soft drinks, as they will make you tired afterwards</div>

  <div class="desc">Dinner should be light yet nutritious. A warm bowl of soup or fresh salad would be good. Eating better food is a good place to start to make healthier habits. Be aware of the foods you eat and observe how they can change your mood or energy. Eat the food that leaves you feeling good and satisfied</div>
